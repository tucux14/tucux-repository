  <p><font color="Green">Hello my name is Edgar Tucux, I am a Sophmore at STEM Academy of Hollywood and some of my hobbies consist of running track. The events that I participate in are the 100 meter sprint, the 100 meter hurdles, and the 4x4.
        The 4x4 race consists of four runners in each team and each one takes a lap before passing the batton. If any runner drops the batton or hand it out to late then you are disqualified from the race.
    Another hobbie of mine would consist of skateboarding, I started to skateboard when I was in seventh grade I take my skateboard with me when I go to school or whenever i'm bored I go out and practice to learn new tricks. 
I started to skateboared because witnessing my older cousin doing tricks and riding around made me want to learn something new and I started to learn how to ride around and do tricks.</font></p> 
<p><font color="white">Another hobbie that I have is playing video games, I play on a ps4. Some games that I enjoy playing are UFC 3, Madden, NBA,and Fortnite.
    These are my top favorite games because I like sports and also enjoy action games as well. I usually play with friends online or with my my siblings, The reason that I like to play sports games is because
it helps understand the plays they use or the moves they use in real life. My final hobbie is playing ukulele, I have had a passion for learning a musical instument and I got surprised with a ukulele and decided to give it a shot.
I learned a couple rock songs on it for example Stairway To Heaven, Come As You Are, and We Don't Believe What's On Tv. I have a lot of hobbies that I do on my free time but these are just a couple.</font></p>
